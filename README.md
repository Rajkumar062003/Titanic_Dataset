# EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on The Titanic Dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in data analysis, involving visual techniques and statistical summaries to understand dataset structure and characteristics. It helps identify patterns, trends, outliers, and missing values.

## Titanic Dataset

The Titanic Dataset contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including demographics, ticket class, cabin information, and survival status. Widely used in predictive modeling and analysis, this dataset provides insights into historical events.

### Dataset Description:
- **Name**: Passenger name.
- **PClass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- **Age**: Passenger age.
- **Sex**: Passenger gender.
- **Survived**: Survival status (1 for survived, 0 for not survived).

### Data Source:
The Titanic Dataset is available from various sources like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, and GitHub. For this analysis, we'll utilize a CSV file containing the Titanic dataset.

### Procedure:
1. **Loading the Dataset:** We'll use the Pandas library to load the Titanic dataset from the CSV file using `read_csv()`.

2. **Data Cleaning:** We'll check for missing values, duplicates, and outliers, handling them as needed.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Various analyses will be performed:
   - Summary statistics: Descriptive statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation.
   - Data visualization: Histograms, box plots, count plots to explore distribution and relationships.
   - Survival analysis: Analyzing survival rates based on passenger class, gender, age, etc.

4. **Interpretation:** Findings from EDA will be interpreted to draw conclusions and insights about the Titanic dataset, including factors influencing survival rates and passenger demographics.
